I'm a little teapot, short and stout
Here is my handle (one hand on hip), here is my spout (other arm out straight)
When I get all steamed up, hear me shout
Just tip me over and pour me out!
(As song ends, lean over and tip arm out like a spout.)

I'm a clever teapot, yes it's true
Here's an example of what I can do
I can change my handle to my spout (Switch arm positions and repeat tipping motion.)
Just tip me over and pour me out.
