Casper, the friendly ghost
The friendliest ghost you know!
The grownups might look at him with fright,
But the children all love him so.

He always says hello
And he's really glad to meet ya'
Wherever he may go,
He's kind to every living creature.

Grownups don't understand,
Why children love him the most,
But kids all know that he loves them so,
Casper the friendly ghost!
