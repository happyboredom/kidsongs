daptation 1

Lullaby and goodnight
With roses be dight
Creep into thy bed
There pillow thy head
If God will thou shalt wake
When the morning doth break
If God will thou shalt wake
When the morning doth break

Lullaby and goodnight
Those blue eyes close tight
Bright angels are near
So sleep without fear
They will guard thee from harm
With fair dreamland's sweet charm
They will guard thee from harm
With fair dreamland's sweet charm
Adaptation 2

Lullaby and goodnight
With roses be dight
With lilies bedecked
In baby's wee bed

Lay thee down now and rest
May thy slumber be blessed
Lay thee down now and rest
May thy slumber be blessed
